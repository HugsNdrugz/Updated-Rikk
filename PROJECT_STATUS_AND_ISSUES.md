# Project Status and Issues Report: "My Nigga Rikk - Street Hustle"

**Date:** (Placeholder for Current Date)

**Overall Summary:**
Significant refactoring has been undertaken to modularize `script.js` by introducing `GameState.js` for state management and `UIManager.js` for DOM manipulation. Several critical fixes and gameplay enhancements from the V2 roadmap have also been implemented. However, development is currently blocked by persistent tooling issues preventing reliable modification of JavaScript files (`script.js`, `classes/CustomerManager.js`).

---

## I. Successfully Completed Work & Verifications:

1.  **Major Refactoring of `script.js` for Modularity:**
    *   Created and integrated `GameState.js` to encapsulate core game state (cash, heat, inventory, player skills, day/turn progression, active events, customer templates, etc.). This includes methods for state access, modification, persistence (`toJSON`/`fromJSON`), and reset.
    *   Created and integrated `UIManager.js` to handle all direct DOM manipulations. This includes `initDOMReferences`, methods for HUD updates, screen transitions, phone UI management, modal interactions, style settings application, and more.
    *   `script.js` was extensively refactored to delegate state and UI responsibilities to these managers, significantly reducing global variables and improving structure. This covered core game loop functions, choice/payload handling, style settings logic, and submenu panel management.

2.  **Addressed Initial Set of Audit Report Items (Phase 1 of "Updated Project Plan"):**
    *   **Obsolete `data_customers.js`:** Resolved by deleting the file and verifying no remaining imports.
    *   **Invalid CSS Selector (`style.css`):** Confirmed that the issue with `.#outfit-splash-tagline` was already fixed (selector is now `.outfit-splash-tagline`).
    *   **Contacts App Data Persistence:** Verified that the event system (`customerTemplatesUpdated`) between `ContactsAppManager.js` and `script.js` (via `GameState`) correctly handles persistence of template edits.
    *   **Range Slider Requirements:** Confirmed with the user that existing HTML range sliders are sufficient for current style variables.

3.  **Implemented World Event Effects (Task 2.1 of "Updated Project Plan"):**
    *   Created `getCombinedActiveEventEffects()` helper in `script.js` to consolidate effects.
    *   Integrated `heatModifier` (affecting passive heat changes and heat from payloads in `script.js`).
    *   Integrated price modifiers (`allPriceModifier`, `drugPriceModifier`) into `CustomerManager.js#_calculateItemValue`.
    *   Integrated `customerScareChance` (customers may be scared off) and `itemScarcity` (affecting items customers sell) in `CustomerManager.js`.
    *   Integrated `dealFailChance` (deals may randomly fail post-choice) in `script.js#handleChoice`.
    *   Integrated `drugDemandModifier` and `specificItemDemand` (influencing customer buying choices) in `CustomerManager.js`.

4.  **Partially Implemented Item & Tool Effects (Task 2.2 of "Updated Project Plan"):**
    *   **Customer Addiction:**
        *   Core logic for customer addiction (status tracking: `isAddicted`, `drugId`, `cravingLevel`; behavioral influence on item preference and pricing; dialogue hooks) implemented in `CustomerManager.js`.
        *   `processPotentialAddiction(customerInstance, soldDrugItem)` method added to `CustomerManager.js` to handle addiction chance and progression (awaiting trigger from `script.js`).

5.  **Partially Created Central `utils.js` Module (Task 3.1 of "Updated Project Plan"):**
    *   `utils.js` file created.
    *   Populated with utility functions: `getRandomElement`, `isLocalStorageAvailable` (from `script.js`), and `createImage`, `createEmptyArray`, `hexToObject`, `decToHex`, `waitFor` (from `SlotGameManager.js`).
    *   `SlotGameManager.js` successfully refactored to import and use these utilities from `utils.js`.

## II. Blocked / Incomplete Tasks Due to Tooling Issues:

The following tasks could not be completed or fully verified due to persistent errors with file modification tools (`overwrite_file_with_block`, `replace_with_git_merge_diff`) when attempting to edit `.js` files (primarily `script.js` and `classes/CustomerManager.js` in the latest attempts).

1.  **Item & Tool Effects (Completion of Task 2.2):**
    *   **Triggering Customer Addiction:** Implementing the call from `script.js#handleChoice` to `game.customerManager.processPotentialAddiction()` after a drug sale.
    *   **Tool Effects (`burner_phone`, `info_cops`):** Implementing their mechanics in `script.js` (e.g., `applyDealHeat` helper, modifying passive heat reduction).
    *   **`info_rival` effect:** Design and implementation.

2.  **Customer Gameplay Logic (Completion of Task 2.3):**
    *   **`gameplayConfig` Preferences in `CustomerManager.js`:** The subtask to implement `buyPreference` and `sellPreference` from `gameplayConfig` in `CustomerManager.js` failed due to tool errors trying to modify the file. This work is NOT currently in `CustomerManager.js`.
    *   **`heatImpact` / `credImpact` in `script.js`:** Implementing logic in `script.js` to apply these impacts from customer templates after deals.

3.  **`utils.js` Integration (Completion of Task 3.1):**
    *   Refactoring `script.js` to import and use `getRandomElement` and `isLocalStorageAvailable` from `utils.js`, and removing its local definitions.

---

## III. Next Steps (Pending Resolution of Tooling Issues):

Once tooling issues are resolved, the immediate priorities would be:

1.  **Complete Blocked Tasks (Section II above).**
    *   Start with `utils.js` integration into `script.js` (Task C.1 from Diagnostic Plan).
    *   Implement `gameplayConfig` preferences in `CustomerManager.js` (Task C.2).
    *   Implement remaining Tool Effects and Addiction Trigger in `script.js` (Tasks C.3, C.4).
    *   Implement `heatImpact`/`credImpact` from `gameplayConfig` in `script.js` (Task C.5).
2.  **Proceed with tasks from "Section D: Remaining Tasks" of the `DIAGNOSTIC_AND_RECOVERY_PLAN.md`:**
    *   Deconstruct `style.css`.
    *   Standardize Development Logging.
    *   Code & Asset Cleanup.
    *   Final UI/UX and Accessibility Review.

**Note on Tooling Issues:**
The primary blocker is the inability to reliably modify JavaScript files. Errors include generic "Edit failed." with `overwrite_file_with_block` and "diff did not apply" / "search blocks were not found" with `replace_with_git_merge_diff`, even with fresh file reads and minimal changes. This needs to be addressed before significant coding progress can resume.
